    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>We weren't innocent lambs by 1977. Even tuba-playing virgins who lived in half-finished, rural Georgia subdivisions knew the times they had a-changed. Television had shown us all about it. Several years before, every day after school, The Andy Griffith Show's kindly Southern sheriff had blurred into the Watergate hearings' kindly Southern Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr., who detailed the antics of our creepy, pitstained pit boss of a president. The Vietnam War had ended infamously as CIA helicopters, sagging with refugees, fled the roof of the U.S. Embassy. &quot;Recession&quot; and &quot;inflation&quot; were a constant refrain. (Who knew what they meant? But they sure made Dad anxious.) My favorite record was the Dickie Goodman novelty 45 &quot;Energy Crisis '74,&quot; which took for granted that the government was manned by incompetent boobs. &quot;With me now is the head of the Federal Energy Office,&quot; intoned a blowhard fake reporter. &quot;Sir, you hold an important position. What are your qualifications?&quot; Cue &quot;sample&quot; of the Steve Miller Band. &quot;I'm a joker / I'm a smoker / I'm a midnight toker.&quot; Then there was the tacky Spirit of '76 marketing flimflam -- the &quot;Buy-centennial&quot; (step right up, get your authentic Independence Hall sawdust!) that begged us all to puff up our denial and get rah-rah about Old Glory. Jimmy Carter, a slippery nonentity with goofy teeth and a reassuring Christian drawl, was elected president, mostly because he seemed like the least harmful option.</p>
