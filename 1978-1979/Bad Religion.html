    <h1>Bad Religion</h1>
    <p>Bad Religion is a punk rock band that formed in Los Angeles in 1979. The band makes extensive use of soaring 3-part vocal harmonies (which they refer to in their album liner notes as the &quot;oozin' aahs&quot;), guitar solos and intellectual lyrics that often contain political or religious commentary. Their lyrics often relate to matters of social responsibility. The band's lineup has changed several times over its lifespan, with lead vocalist Greg Graffin being the only consistent member; the current lineup, however, features three out of four of the band's original members (Graffin, Brett Gurewitz and Jay Bentley). Bad Religion has released seventeen studio albums (one of which is a Christmas album), two live albums, three compilation albums, two EPs, and two DVDs (which were both recorded live). Although they gained a cult following with many of their early albums, Bad Religion did not experience major worldwide commercial success until the 1994 release of their eighth studio album Stranger Than Fiction, which spawned their biggest hits &quot;Infected&quot; and a re-recorded version of &quot;21st Century (Digital Boy)&quot;, and was certified gold in both the United States and Canada. Their latest album, True North, was released on January 22, 2013. Bad Religion has sold over 5 million albums worldwide,and along with many of their contemporaries—such as The Offspring, Green Day, Rancid, NOFX and Social Distortion—they are one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time.</p>
